# How To Use

Using the NaviSense DocTree is simple. You are already on the home page of the documentation, and accessing any document related to the project and its codebase can be done here.

Each main document can be found on this home page and is given their own section along with a short description. All the subsections of the DocTree can also be accessed through the Section List by the left side of this page (as you can no doubt verify).

### On Adjusting the Documentation
The documentation is deployed through Mkdocs. This means that each page, or document for that matter, found in this documentation, other than links to PDFs, is generated from markdown files. The structure of this DocTree is defined in *mkdocs.yml* which can be found in the root folder of the [codebase](https://github.com/sceptysm/NaviSense-2025-2026/tree/main). The Sections can be found within the codebase under *root/docs/* and it is here where any changes to the Documentation can be made. Adding new Sections requires only the creation of a new markdown file and for that file to also be added to the mkdocs.yml.
