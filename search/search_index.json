Here you'll find key artifacts and design information. How To Use \u00b6 Using the NaviSense DocTree is simple. You are already on the home page of the documentation, and accessing any document related to the project and its codebase can be done here. Each main document can be found on this home page and is given their own section along with a short description. All the subsections of the DocTree can also be accessed through the Section List by the left side of this page (as you can no doubt verify). The documentation is deployed through Mkdocs. This means that each page, or document for that matter, found in this documentation, other than links to PDFs, is generated from markdown files. The structure of this DocTree is defined in mkdocs.yml which can be found in the root folder of the codebase. The Sections can be found within the codebase under root/docs/ and it is here where any changes to the Documentation can be made. Adding new Sections requires only the creation of a new markdown file and for that file to also be added to the mkdocs.yml. Description \u00b6 Start here with the overall aim, scope, and other information about the project. Project Description Product Requirements 2025/2026 \u00b6 This document outlines the features that the dev product must be capable of by the end of the 2025/2026 TU/e Honors year. Product Requirements 2025/2026 Decisions \u00b6 The following document describes major design decisions along with their drivers. This includes the information like dependencies and technology chosen for the product on the basis of aspects like information about the end-user and cost of development.

The aim is to agree on shared methods of working to improve collaboration efficiency. The key topics covered are: - Two-Week Sprint Cycle - Communication Channels - Knowledge Management Two-Week Sprint Cycle \u00b6 The project follows an agile development framework centered around two-week sprints . The team works backwards from high-level objectives, breaking them into manageable tasks while allowing flexibility to adapt to issues as they arise. Sprint Phases \u00b6 1. Sprint Planning \u00b6 At the beginning (or end) of each two-week cycle, the team reviews the project backlog and selects tasks for the upcoming sprint. The goal is to ensure: - A realistic workload - Clear and well-defined objectives 2. Development \u00b6 During the sprint, development proceeds according to the communication and coding guidelines defined in later sections. 3. Sprint Review \u00b6 At the end of each sprint, the team conducts the following activities: a. Review Each developer presents a brief demo of their work and records any feedback from the client or team members. b. Retrospective The team reflects on: - What worked well - What could be improved - Any obstacles encountered c. Backlog Update Completed items are signed off, and new tasks are added based on sprint outcomes. Project Backlog \u00b6 The sprint process relies on a Project Backlog , maintained as: - A simple spreadsheet, or - A task management tool such as Trello or Asana Each backlog item should include: - A brief description - Priority level (High / Medium / Low) - Estimated effort Communication Channels \u00b6 The team uses multiple communication channels to keep discussions organized and easy to reference. Discord: Development Hub \u00b6 Discord serves as the primary development communication platform. 1. Formal Discussions Log \u00b6 All technical and design discussions must be logged in a dedicated Discussions channel to create a searchable decision history. This also applies to development issues where feedback from the team is needed. Each discussion should follow this structure: Discussion Topic Brief description of the topic Example: Issue A \u2013 User Authentication Problem Topic Description Clear scope of the issue Example: As part of feature X, we must implement user authentication. I am encountering problem Y. Discussion Messages Messages exchanged between team members Decision Summary A final post summarizing the agreed outcome of the discussion 2. Information Hub \u00b6 The main Discord channel contains links to essential project resources, including: - GitHub repository - OneDrive - Other relevant tools WhatsApp: Social and Personal Coordination \u00b6 WhatsApp is reserved for informal and logistical communication, including: - Checking in on team well-being - Coordinating meetings - Non-technical discussions Communication with the Client \u00b6 Client communication occurs at the start of each sprint cycle During the first sprint , objectives are communicated via email to: j.pintado@student.tue.nl For subsequent sprints, emails should include: Progress update from the previous sprint Objectives for the upcoming sprint Email subject format: Sprint Cycle # Update (where # is the sprint number) Monthly Updates \u00b6 Updates on other events (e.g., TU/e contest) are sent on the first day of each month Updates should include current progress and reflections Meetings \u00b6 Full-team meetings occur: - At the beginning of the year - Before the Midterm Presentation - Before Demo Day Additional questions or requests where the client can help may be handled via WhatsApp. Knowledge Management \u00b6 This section describes how the team captures and maintains knowledge throughout the project. Cloud OneDrive \u00b6 The shared OneDrive stores all non-code project assets , ensuring access to the latest versions. Contents include: - Project Foundations \u2013 project descriptions, user personas, and long-term vision documents - Past Context \u2013 reports and materials from previous years - Research and Research Briefs \u2013 sources and research materials - Design and Architecture \u2013 detailed architecture and design documents - Organizational Documents \u2013 project backlog and sprint planning files GitHub Repository \u00b6 All code is managed through a shared GitHub repository using a structured workflow. 1. Feature Branch Workflow \u00b6 New features must be developed on a branch created from the main development branch Branches should follow the naming convention: feature-x-branch Example: user-login-branch 2. Merge Requests \u00b6 Once a feature is complete and tested locally, a merge request is opened Each merge request must include: A clear description of the changes Relevant context for reviewers 3. Meaningful Commit Messages \u00b6 Clear and descriptive commit messages are mandatory. For significant feature work, commit messages should follow this structure: [Task or Feature Name] Feature Description: I implemented the user registration endpoint by creating a new service and repository in the auth module. Next Steps: To complete the user login feature, I still need to implement token generation.","title":"Way of Working"},{"location":"way-of-working/#way-of-working","text":"","title":"Way of Working"},{"location":"way-of-working/#a-guide-to-our-collaborative-process","text":"This document outlines the development methodology, communication channels, and collaborative practices for our project.
