You are already on the home page of the documentation, and accessing any document related to the project and its codebase can be done here.</p> <p>Each main document can be found on this home page and is given their own section along with a short description. All the subsections of the DocTree can also be accessed through the Section List by the left side of this page (as you can no doubt verify).</p> <p>The documentation is deployed through Mkdocs. This means that each page, or document for that matter, found in this documentation, other than links to PDFs, is generated from markdown files. The structure of this DocTree is defined in mkdocs.yml which can be found in the root folder of the codebase. The Sections can be found within the codebase under root/docs/ and it is here where any changes to the Documentation can be made. Adding new Sections requires only the creation of a new markdown file and for that file to also be added to the mkdocs.yml.</p>"},{"location":"#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Start here with the overall aim, scope, and other information about the project.</p> <ul> <li>Project Description </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#product-requirements-20252026","title":"Product Requirements 2025/2026","text":"<p>This document outlines the features that the dev product must be capable of by the end of the 2025/2026 TU/e Honors year. </p> <ul> <li>Product Requirements 2025/2026</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#decisions","title":"Decisions","text":"<p>The following document describes major design decisions along with their drivers.
